## Security Features

### 1. Secure Token Storage
- Tokens stored in iOS Keychain with biometric protection
- Integration with existing SecurityManager encryption
- Automatic cleanup on sign-out

### 2. Privacy Compliance
- GDPR/CCPA compliant data handling
- User consent management
- Data export and deletion capabilities
- Integration with existing AppStoreComplianceManager

### 3. Session Security
- Automatic token refresh
- Session expiry handling
- Network-aware operations
- Secure session storage

## Installation Requirements

### 1. Swift Package Dependencies
Add the following package to your Xcode project:
```
https://github.com/google/GoogleSignIn-iOS
```

Include both `GoogleSignIn` and `GoogleSignInSwift` products.

### 2. Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Create OAuth client ID for iOS
2. Download `GoogleService-Info.plist`
3. Configure bundle identifier
4. Set up authorized domains

### 3. Xcode Configuration
1. Add `GoogleService-Info.plist` to project
2. Configure URL schemes in Info.plist
3. Add required imports to app files
4. Update deployment target if needed

## Integration with Existing Systems

### 1. Security Infrastructure
- Leverages existing `SecurityManager` for encryption
- Uses `KeychainManager` for secure storage
- Integrates with biometric authentication

### 2. Privacy Compliance
- Extends existing `PrivacySettings` structure
- Uses `AppStoreComplianceManager` for consent
- Supports existing data export workflows

### 3. SDUI Architecture
- Authentication screens can be server-driven
- Dynamic error handling and messaging
- Supports existing component library

### 4. Network Monitoring
- Integrates with existing `NetworkMonitor`
- Handles offline authentication scenarios
- Optimizes token refresh based on connectivity

## Testing

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests for all core components
- Integration tests with existing systems
- Mock objects for Google SDK
- Performance tests for critical paths

### Test Files
- `PestGenieTests/AuthenticationTests.swift`
- Covers authentication flows, token management, session handling
- Includes security and privacy compliance tests

## Error Handling

### Authentication Errors
- `AuthenticationError` enum with localized descriptions
- Proper error propagation to UI
- Security event logging

### Recovery Strategies
- Automatic token refresh
- Session restoration on app launch
- Graceful degradation for network issues

## Performance Considerations

### Memory Management
- Profile image caching with automatic cleanup
- Efficient token storage and retrieval
- Proper lifecycle management for managers

### Network Efficiency
- Token refresh only when necessary
- Network-aware operations
- Proper timeout handling

## Privacy and Compliance

### Data Handling
- Minimal data collection (email, name, profile image)
- User consent before data processing
- Secure storage with encryption

### GDPR/CCPA Compliance
- Data export functionality
- User data deletion
- Clear privacy policy integration
- Consent management

### App Store Compliance
- Privacy manifest support (iOS 17+)
- Required SDK signatures
- Proper capability declarations
