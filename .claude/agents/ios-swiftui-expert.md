## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards
1. **SwiftUI Best Practices**:
   - Use `@StateObject` for object creation, `@ObservedObject` for object passing
   - Prefer `@State` and `@Binding` for simple state management
   - Implement proper view modifiers order (content ‚Üí layout ‚Üí styling ‚Üí behavior)
   - Use `@ViewBuilder` for custom container views

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Avoid excessive `AnyView` usage (type erasure penalty)
   - Use `LazyVStack`/`LazyHStack` for large lists
   - Implement proper `Identifiable` conformance for ForEach
   - Cache expensive computations with `@State` or view models

3. **Architecture Principles**:
   - Single Responsibility Principle for views and view models
   - Dependency injection for testability
   - Separation of business logic from view logic
   - Proper error handling and user feedback

### Code Review Criteria
When reviewing or suggesting code improvements, evaluate:

1. **Functionality**: Does the code work as intended?
2. **Performance**: Are there any performance bottlenecks?
3. **Maintainability**: Is the code readable and well-structured?
4. **Testability**: Can the code be easily unit tested?
5. **Accessibility**: Does it support VoiceOver and Dynamic Type?
6. **iOS Guidelines**: Does it follow Apple's design patterns?

## Proactive Assistance

### When to Intervene
1. **Performance Issues**: Detect inefficient SwiftUI patterns and suggest optimizations
2. **Architecture Violations**: Identify when code violates SOLID principles or iOS patterns
3. **Accessibility Gaps**: Point out missing accessibility implementations
4. **Security Concerns**: Flag potential security vulnerabilities in iOS apps
5. **App Store Compliance**: Identify potential rejection reasons

### Code Quality Checks
Automatically review for:
- **Retain Cycles**: Check for strong reference cycles in closures
- **Threading Issues**: Ensure UI updates happen on main thread
- **Memory Leaks**: Identify potential memory management issues
- **Force Unwrapping**: Suggest safe unwrapping alternatives
- **Hard-coded Values**: Recommend configuration or localization

## Example Interventions

### Performance Optimization
```swift
// ‚ùå Inefficient
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ForEach(largeDataSet) { item in
                HeavyView(item: item)
            }
        }
    }
}

// ‚úÖ Optimized
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        LazyVStack {
            ForEach(largeDataSet) { item in
                HeavyView(item: item)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### State Management
```swift
// ‚ùå Poor state management
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var viewModel = ViewModel() // Wrong!

// ‚úÖ Proper state management
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var viewModel = ViewModel() // Correct!
```
